## 📌 Problem Statement

Underwater marine debris such as **ghost nets, pipes, cylinders, containers, shipwrecks and other man-made structures** can pose serious risks to marine biodiversity, coral reefs and vessel operations.

Side-Scan Sonar (SSS) is widely used to map the seafloor, but manually inspecting large volumes of sonar imagery is:

* Time-consuming
* Labor-intensive
* Prone to human error
* Difficult in noisy acoustic environments
* Challenging when artificial objects resemble natural seabed formations

The objective is to build an end-to-end AI system that can automatically analyze SSS imagery and convert detections into **geo-localized, confidence-scored and actionable anomaly information**.

---

# 💡 Our Solution

We developed a **Sonar-Aware AI pipeline** that combines computer vision with sonar-specific analysis.

The key idea is to avoid relying only on raw object-detection confidence. The system also considers **acoustic-shadow evidence, sonar image quality and contextual information** before producing an actionable anomaly.

# 🚀 Key Features

### 🔍 AI-Based Object Detection

The system uses a YOLO-based object detection pipeline for identifying underwater objects and anomalies in Side-Scan Sonar imagery.

The deployment pipeline supports:

* PyTorch model
* ONNX model
* CPU inference
* Non-Maximum Suppression
* Confidence scoring
* Tiled inference

---

### 🌊 Sonar-Aware Preprocessing

The pipeline is designed specifically for acoustic imagery and includes:

* Grayscale conversion
* Median denoising
* Intensity normalization
* Contrast enhancement
* Sonar image quality assessment
* Dropout analysis
* Nadir-related processing
* Tiled image inference

---

### 🌑 Acoustic Shadow Analysis

Acoustic shadows are an important characteristic of sonar imagery.

The system analyzes relationships between:

```text
Bright Acoustic Highlight
          +
Dark Acoustic Shadow
          ↓
Potential Artificial Structure
```

Shadow-related evidence is combined with AI detection results to help distinguish artificial objects from natural seabed formations.

---

### 🧠 Artificial vs Natural Assessment

The system estimates:

* Artificial probability
* Natural probability
* Shadow score
* Noise score
* Model confidence
* Final confidence

This provides additional context beyond a conventional object detector.

---

### 📍 Sonar-Based Geolocation

When navigation metadata is available, detections can be localized using:

* Latitude
* Longitude
* Heading
* Sonar range
* Port/starboard information
* Depth
* Navigation source
* Detection position relative to the sonar nadir

The system distinguishes between:

```text
REAL
ESTIMATED
UNAVAILABLE
```

coordinates instead of fabricating a location when sufficient navigation information is unavailable.

---

### 📏 Object Dimension Estimation

The system estimates physical dimensions from sonar geometry and image coordinates.

These measurements are intended as **estimates for anomaly analysis**, rather than survey-grade measurements.

---

### 🗺️ GIS & Visualization

The web application provides visualization of detected anomalies using:

* Interactive maps
* GeoJSON
* GIS layers
* Sonar image overlays
* Cesium-based 3D visualization
* Detection details
* Survey information

---

### 👨‍🔬 Human-in-the-Loop Verification

Detected anomalies can be reviewed by a human operator.

Supported review states include:

```text
PENDING_REVIEW
VERIFIED
REJECTED
NEEDS_REVIEW
```

Review information can include:

* Reviewer
* Review timestamp
* Comments
* Verification status

This allows AI results to be validated before operational use.

---

### 📊 Automated Reporting

The system supports generation of:

* PDF reports
* CSV reports
* JSON reports
* GeoJSON reports

Reports can contain information such as:

```text
Detection
Class
Confidence
Artificial Probability
Natural Probability
Latitude
Longitude
Dimensions
Risk / Review Status
```

## 🏷️ Detection Classes

The project architecture supports multiple marine-anomaly categories, including:

* Shipwreck
* Artificial Structure
* Rock
* Marine Debris
* Container
* Pipe
* Cylinder
* Ghost Net

### Dataset note

The final trained model's validated performance should be interpreted according to the **genuine labeled samples available for each class**. Classes without sufficient representative labeled sonar data should not be presented as fully validated detection classes.

---

## 📚 Dataset

The project uses labeled Side-Scan Sonar imagery for training and evaluation.

The dataset preparation pipeline supports:

* Image validation
* Annotation validation
* Duplicate detection
* Dataset splitting
* Class distribution analysis
* YOLO-format annotations
* Train/validation/test separation

The reduced submission version uses a **balanced representative subset** to satisfy deployment/submission size constraints while maintaining genuine labeled samples and preventing train/test leakage.

---

## 🏋️ Model Training

The project includes an existing YOLO training pipeline.

Training workflow:

```

Training can evaluate:

* Precision
* Recall
* F1 Score
* mAP@50
* mAP@50–95
* Per-class metrics

---

## ⚡ Edge / CPU Inference

The trained model can be exported to **ONNX** and executed through CPU inference.

This supports the project's goal of reducing dependency on heavy cloud infrastructure and provides a pathway toward resource-constrained marine platforms.

> Current CPU benchmarking should be interpreted as a software inference benchmark, not as proof of deployment on a specific AUV or marine drone hardware platform.

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

The project is designed as an AI-assisted sonar analysis system, and several limitations should be considered:

* Detection quality depends on the availability and diversity of labeled Side-Scan Sonar data.
* Rare marine-debris classes require representative labeled samples for reliable supervised training.
* Estimated object dimensions are not a substitute for survey-grade measurements.
* Geolocation quality depends on available navigation metadata.
* Full physical image-level compensation for all heave/pitch/roll effects is an area for further development.
* Production-grade parsing of every proprietary raw sonar-log format requires dedicated format-specific integration.
* AI predictions should be reviewed by qualified operators before operational decisions.

---

## 🔬 Future Scope

Future improvements can include:

* Larger multi-survey sonar datasets
* More representative ghost-net and marine-debris samples
* Cross-sensor/domain validation
* Improved rare-class detection
* Semantic segmentation
* Advanced motion compensation
* Native XTF/JSF processing
* Multi-sensor fusion
* Improved sonar geolocation
* AUV/edge-device deployment
* Continuous human-in-the-loop learning
* Active-learning based dataset expansion

---

## 🧪 Evaluation

The project includes an evaluation pipeline for measuring:

```text

### External Services Required
**None**. The application does NOT require MongoDB, MongoDB Atlas, Redis, BullMQ, Upstash, Supabase, or Firebase. All persistent entities run on a high-performance in-process memory store, and all background jobs (sonar frame processing, training) run via an in-process asynchronous queue.

### Data Persistence Model
* **Application State & Metadata:** Stored in-memory in the central `MemoryStore`. On server restart, demo data (users, surveys, NOAA historical references, verified anomalies) is automatically seeded cleanly.
* **Uploaded Files & AI Models:** Sonar frames, uploads, reports, and trained ONNX models are stored directly on the local filesystem under `STORAGE_LOCAL_PATH` (`backend/data`). On persistent platforms (e.g. Railway with volume or Docker with volume), mounting this folder preserves all media across restarts.

---

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|

| **Operator** | `operator@marinevision.ai` | `Operator@12345` |
